        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also make the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Feedback, contact information and reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
      <p>We are always looking to improve our service, including its accessibility.</p>
      <p>If you find any problems that are not listed on this page or you think we’re not meeting the accessibility requirements, please raise a <a href="mailto:{{ PhaseBannerUtils.supportDeskLink }}" class="govuk-link">support ticket</a> to get help or raise a bug.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p>
      The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies 
      (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). 
      If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com" target="blank" class="govuk-link">Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about accessibility in this service</h2>
      <p>HMPPS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
      <p>
      This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p>
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
      </p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Some conditionally revealed input options are not announced by screen readers. This is not communicated via screen readers. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value). See known issues for <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/#known-issues">checkboxes</a> and <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/#known-issues">radio buttons</a> in the GOV.UK Design System.</li>
        <li>Some error message links do not shift focus to the error field. This creates an unequal experience for keyboard users, as they can’t directly jump to the fields as intended. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships), 1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence) and 2.4.3 (Focus Order).</li>
        <li>Some page headings are not semantically coded as such in the HTML meaning screen reader users do not receive the same cues. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
        <li>Some page heading structures do not accurately reflect the visual hierarchy and are not intuitive. Inaccurate heading hierarchy can lead to confusion and difficulty in navigating the page with screen readers. This also impacts related PDFs. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
        <li>Some navigation links do not reflow properly on browser zoom. This reflow behaviour presents significant challenges for users with visual impairments or those who rely on magnification software. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p>We will continue to do internal audits to check the accessibility of this service, as well as taking feedback from users.</p>
      <p>Any changes required will be planned into our ongoing work on this service.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
      <p>
      This statement was prepared on 13 May 2024 and was last reviewed on 13 January 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website’s last external test was in May 2024 against the WCAG 2.2 AA standard. This test of a representative sample of pages was carried out by <a href="https://uservision.co.uk/">User Vision</a>.
      </p>

        We also used findings from our own testing when preparing this accessibility statement.
